# BatchNormalization

Using TensorFlow framework to integrate [Batch Normalization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03167.pdf) into Neural Networks.

Each folder contains the code on 3 datasets: MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100.
The ANN is for Fully Connected Feedforward Neural Networks.
The CNN is for Convolutional Neural Networks.
